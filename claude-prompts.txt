# Prompt: review for Sora
Scan the file {file_path} for references to "Sora", "sora-client", or other Sora-related APIs.
For each usage, output:
1) the line number and exact line,
2) a one-sentence remediation plan (stub / replace with LongCat / remove),
3) if code change is required, produce a git-style patch that performs that change.

# Prompt: generate unit test for client
Write a vitest unit test for {file_path} that:
- stubs global fetch,
- calls generateVideo and getGenerationStatus,
- asserts that returned objects contain {id,status,url} keys and that status maps to 'succeeded' for mocked success.

# Prompt: produce PR body
Write a PR body describing the change:
- short summary,
- list of files modified,
- how tested (npm test, npx netlify-cli build),
- rollback instructions,
- which env secrets were removed or added.
